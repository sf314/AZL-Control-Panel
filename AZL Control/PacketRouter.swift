/* Packet Router
 Decide which structure to send the packet to, and send it
 Expected structure: [packet ID, data, data, ..., data]
 
 Expected packet types:
 ID: Provided upon startup to alert the CP of all telemetry fields. Provides
    a named string and integer ID for it. Will be stored in a telem dictionary.
 DAT: Provided during runtime to add new telemetry data. Passes the integer ID 
    of the field to be updated, as well as the data itself.
 LIM: Provided necessarily during runtime to set new max/min limits for a data
    point. Requires the integer ID of the desired telemetry field.
